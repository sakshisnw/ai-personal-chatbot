## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot leverages a transformer model to understand and respond to your messages. Streamlit creates a lightweight and responsive UI for seamless interactions.

### 🔄 Simple Loop

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    response = get_bot_response(user_input)
    print("Bot:", response)
```

But now — it's in a **web app form**!
